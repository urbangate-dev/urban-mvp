## Installation

Install all dependencies by opening a new terminal (or use the same terminal) and run "npm i".

To access all environment variables, make sure the application is linked to vercel. Run "vercel link" to link to the existing project, then run "vercel env pull" to retrieve env variables.

To run the application, run "npm run dev". To access the database with prisma studio, run "npx prisma studio".
